<body>
	In 1969, by a crazy lucky confluence of irrational decisions,
	I found myself in the presence of a tuba.
	<br>
	Playing in a stairwell, a young man told me of the Afro-American Lab Band, directed by the great mentor Ken McIntyre.
	<br>
	With no bass player in sight, I was assigned the role.
	<br>
	I couldn't read music worth beans, but I knew the names of the notes, and major from minor,
	so with my ear, I was all set.
	A chance to solo on a blues cemented my rep.
	
	A militant-oriented jazz combo was being assembled for the Quinnipiac Jazz Festival.
	The Creative Black Arts Sextet.  It had five musicians.  No bass player.  You can see the problem.
	<br>
	Mr. McIntyre, not yet Makunda, said, "Get Roger, he can play."
	We went to the Festival.  We played John Coltrane's Equinox. And we played Richie Harper's Liberation, which was in three, and our instructions were to keep the three solid inside while taking it way way outside.  It worked amazing, powerful.  I sat right on the stage.
