<p>Having been convicted of Synergism under the Court of Saxe-Weimar, Professor 
  Beautiful was renditioned to a small jail cell in Texas, whence he encountered 
  a man in finery, wig and hose. He introduced himself as Mister Bach Jangles. 
  Humming a few ditties in four parts, he explained "I drinks a bit." Inspired, 
  the Professor broke off a drain pipe, twisted in a pecuilar way that brought 
  to Mr. Bach's eyes a look of wonder and not a little fear. "Relax, old man, 
  the tuba hasn't even been invented yet. Until now." The old man was heard to 
  remark under his vaporous breath, "son, that ain't no cello".</p>

  Years later, PB was publicly accused of creating dangerous music before a crowd 
  of a thousand college students. This time, no jail sentence was imposed. Instead, 
  he was conferred the honor of an empty envelope. Stanley Clarke got one too.
