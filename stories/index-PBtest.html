The origins of Professor Beautiful
</strong></em></font></p>
An e-mail from an astonishingly beautiful friend: 
<blockquote>Hello,<br>
Beautiful<br>
Thank You<br>
Peace and Blessings<br>
</blockquote>
<p>One could read this two ways. 
A few minutes later there came a very sweet, embarassed disclaimer. 
<blockquote>Ooooops
I didn't mean you are beautiful, I meant, the message you send to everyone was beautiful..well written..
sorry..
and i don't mean you are ugly either.oh my......you know what i mean? lol 
</blockquote>  She didn't have to worry. 
  But the damage was done. And so Professor Beautiful 
  was born. <br>
  I love the name; it's so lame and pathetic and embarassing! 
  It's helped me to ascend to the soaring heights of humility </p>

<p><em><strong>That was when I wrote &#8220;The Bass Saxophone,&#8221; and I was 
  writing about fidelity, <br>
  about the sole real art there is, about what one must be true to, come hell 
  or high water; <br>
  what must be done to the point of collapse, even if it be a very minor art, 
  the object of <br>
  condescending sneers.</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>(From International Cello Society web site) <br>
  &quot;Here is an excerpt from Piatigorsky's book, in which he writes of an encounter 
  with <br>
  Pablo Casals, that reveals Casal's prodigious memory, attention to minute detail, 
  and <br>
  human warmth:&quot;</strong></em></p>
<p>My great wish was to hear Pablo Casals. One day my desire was <br>
  almost fulfilled and I met him. But ironically, it was I who had to <br>
  play. It was in the home of the Von Mendelssohns, a house filled <br>
  with El Grecos, Rembrandts, and Stradivarius. Francesco von <br>
  Mendelssohn, the son of the banker, who was a talented cellist, <br>
  telephoned and asked if he could call for me; they had a guest in <br>
  the house who would like to hear me play.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Casals,&quot; I was introduced to a little bald man with a pipe. 
  He <br>
  said that he was pleased to meet young musicians such as Serkin <br>
  and me. Rudolf Serkin, who stood stiffly next to me, seemed , like <br>
  myself, to be fighting his diffidence. Rudi had played before my <br>
  arrival, and Casals now wanted to hear us together. Beethoven's D-<br>
  Major Sonata was on the piano. &quot;Why don't you play it?&quot; asked <br>
  Casals. Both nervous and barely knowing each other, we gave a <br>
  poor performance that terminated somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>&quot;Bravo! Bravo! Wonderful!&quot; Casals applauded. Francesco brought <br>
  the Schumann Cello Concerto, which Casals wanted to hear. I <br>
  never played worse. Casals asked for Bach. Exasperated, I obliged <br>
  with a performance matching the Beethoven and Schumann.</p>
<p>&quot;Splendid! Magnifique!&quot; said Casals, embracing me.</p>
<p>&quot;Bewildered, I left the house. I knew how badly I had played, but <br>
  why did he, the master, have to praise and embrace me? This <br>
  apparent insincerity pained me more than anything else.</p>
<p>&quot;The greater was my shame and delight when, a few years later, I <br>
  met Casals in Paris. We had dinner together and played duets for <br>
  two cellos, and I played for him until late at night. Spurred by his <br>
  great warmth, and happy, I confessed what I had thought of his <br>
  praising me in Berlin. He reacted with sudden anger. He rushed to <br>
  the cello, &quot;Listen!&quot; He played a phrase from the Beethoven sonata. 
  <br>
  &quot;Didn't you play this fingering? Ah, you did! It was novel to me...it <br>
  was good...and here, didn't you attack that passage with up-bow, <br>
  like this? he demonstrated. He went through Schumann and Bach, <br>
  always emphasizing all he liked that I had done. &quot;And for the rest,&quot; 
  <br>
  he said passionately, &quot;<strong>leave it to the ignorant and stupid who 
  judge <br>
  by counting only the faults. I can be grateful, and so must you be, <br>
  for even one note, one wonderful phrase</strong>.&quot; I left with the feeling 
  of <br>
  having been with a great artist and a friend.</p>
