<p><em><strong>- From Josef Skvorecky, &#8221;Red Music&#8221;, in The Bass Saxophone</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>That was when I wrote &#8220;The Bass Saxophone,&#8221; and I was 
  writing about fidelity, <br>
  about the sole real art there is, about what one must be true to, come hell 
  or high water; <br>
  what must be done to the point of collapse, even if it be a very minor art, 
  the object of <br>
  condescending sneers.</strong></em></p></body>
