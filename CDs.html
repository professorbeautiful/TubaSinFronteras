B&eacute;same CD  "Primer Beso"

</h2>
<blockquote>
    "For this first, full-length album, B&eacute;same takes you across Colombia from the Atlantic Coast to the Pacific Coast, 
    <br>with a few side trips to neighboring countries thrown in for good measure. 
    <br>The idea was to create a collection that showcases some of the amazing traditional music the region has to offer, 
    <br>but more importantly, a collection that makes you want to dance and sway to the music!"

 Here's <a href="http://community.post-gazette.com/blogs/bluenotes/archive/2009/10/26/ernie-hawkins.aspx"> a review. </a>  Also:
<blockquote>
    "The intersection of the blues and jazz that thrived along the mythical Mississippi from Basin to Beale Street.
  <br>  Features finger-picked Piedmont guitar with tuba, trumpet, trombone, clarinet, harmonica, bass and washboard."
     <br>  with George Heid, Joe Dallas, Dwayne Dolphin, Joe Cosentino, Marc Reisman, and Roger Day, who is no slouch either, <br>oh of course he is.
