  <li>To make me less humble.</li>

    A few minutes later came this:<br>
    <kbd>&quot;Ooooops<br>
    I didn't mean you are beautiful, I meant, the message you send to everyone 
    was beautiful..well written..<br>
    sorry..<br>
    and i don't mean you are ugly either.oh my......you know what i mean? lol&quot;
